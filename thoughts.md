### Thought 0001, The Past

What if? a question I stopped asking a long time ago, I no longer remember why I'm obsessively trying to avoid, or why at this very moment I trying not to remember. But I still feel as if something is missing. I no longer agonize over the past but I'm over thinking every step I'm making and I'm getting better at making decisions, but at the same time I feel disconnected from my reality, from the people, from everything. The only thing that pushes me forward is probably my survival instinct, but what will happen when I no longer fear for that. when I don't have to do anything anymore, will I chose to do something myself, or will the fear of failure and loss cripples me.
It occurred to me lately, I never made a leap of faith, I never tried without knowing in advance I'm going to succeed. I either let the environment decide for me when I think that suits me or I capitalize on the skills I already have.
Nothing new, no risks. why bother. when you can't foresee all the scenarios, when you can't explain all the actions, when I can't make sense of what is happening, that is the nightmare I am striving to avoid. I won't say I can make sense of everything. but at least as I said if it wasn't expected, then it only lives in the past, and the past doesn't concern me.
